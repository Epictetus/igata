        %li The Terms of Service, product itself, and our prices may change over time. We'll warn you 30 days in advance of any price changes. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service or website features or functionality, but we make no guarantees.

        %li This document is based upon the Automattic Privacy Policy. This document is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5. Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit the original authors somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with Igata in any way, nor do they sponsor or endorse Igata or its use of the work.
        %li DockYard, LLC. ("Igata") makes available services including our web sites (dockyard.com and igata.io), our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Igata in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service").

      %h4 Visitors
      %ul
        %li Like most website operators, Igata collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Igata also collects anonymized information about how visitors use the Service. Igata collects this information for purposes such as billing, quality of service improvement, contact, and feature development / research. From time to time, Igata may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website or a summary of common website problems found through analysis of customer data.
        %li Igata also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Igata does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.
      %h4 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
      %ul
        %li Certain visitors to Igata's websites choose to interact with Igata in ways that require Igata to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Igata gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Igata collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Igata. Igata does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.
        %li Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.
      %h4 Aggregated Statistics
      %ul
        %li Igata may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, Igata may monitor the most popular parts of the igata.io. Igata may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Igata does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
      %h4 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
      %ul
        %li Igata discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Igata's behalf or to provide services available at Igata's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Igata will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Igata discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Igata believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Igata, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Igata may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Igata and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Igata takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
      %h4 Cookies
      %ul
        %li A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. Igata uses cookies to help Igata identify and track visitors, their usage of Igata Service, and their Service access preferences. Igata visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Igata's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Igata's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
      %h4 Data Storage
      %ul
        %li Igata uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.
      %h4 Privacy Policy Changes
      %ul
        %li Although most changes are likely to be minor, Igata may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Igata's sole discretion. Igata encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
